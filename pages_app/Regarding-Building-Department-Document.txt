Hello !

I have attached the final version of the building department documentation for your review.

Please note that the table of contents includes “place holder” screen captures of the true AutoCAD PDF files.
If we or the building department “zoom in” on those screen captures the text is barely legible, practically useless.

The last 11 pages of this document are the true AutoCAD PDF files, but they are not listed in the table of contents.
I was able to use the Apple Preview.app to add the true AutoCAD PDF files after I exported the Apple Pages.app document as a PDF file.

If we or the building department “zoom in” on these true AutoCAD PDF files they will be very happy as they are truly legible at all zoom levels, clean as we would expect from AutoCAD.

If you choose to upload this file, please include this explanation.

Tomorrow / Thursday I will try to “remove” the screen captures and insert the true AutoCAD PDFs using the Apple Preview.app.
Inserting the AutoCAD PDFs into the Apple Pages.app directly doesn’t work as expected and that is why I used the screen capture.

Maybe removing the screen captures and inserting the AutoCAD PDFs will work using the Preview.app.
If that should work, the table of contents will still be correct,  but the page numbers will be missing from the AutoCAD drawing PDF files.
