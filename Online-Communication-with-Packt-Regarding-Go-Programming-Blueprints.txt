Communication with Packt regarding my purchase of Go Programming Blueprints on Monday August 19, 2024.

I purchased Go Programming Blueprints (order #2182668) but only HTML/online reading seems to work. I want to download it, as PDF as I have my other Packt purchases.

Also, It seems there are two Go Programming Blueprints in my Packt library, and I am only purchasing one of them. So please ensure that I am not being charged twice.  Feel free to remove one of them if necessary.

Thanks
